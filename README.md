# MLP optimization using Gradient-Decent-with-momentum
Experiment: What is the performance change when Gradient Decent adopts momentum in Multi Layer perceptron  parameter optimization

Momentum is to speed up any process/movement. GD momentum is not the momentum we studied in physics.
What does momentum do : We push GD more in to the direction, indicated by gradient.

What is nesterov momentum : Instead going ahead in same direction, go ahead and check whether the direction gives a better loss reduction.This would reduce number of jumps and time of execution.
